# Free Electron in a Moebiüs Strip

I analize this problem through the lens of quantum mechanics. Using the Shröedinger equation one can find the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the system, and the solutions of the equation are visualized and explored with the help of a Jupyter Notebook.

The folder `moebius_vids` contains multiple examples of solutions of the system, every example includes a video of the solution and a `.txt` file with the parameters of the solution.
